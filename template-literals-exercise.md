# Template Literals Exercise

Given the data in the code snippet below, use a template string to produce the
following string...

```text
There are 4 people on the tooling team.
Their names are Jennie, Ronald, Martin, Anneli.
```

Make sure the numbers, names, and team name actually come from the data. They should not be hardcoded into the `message` variable.

```js
const teamName = "tooling"
const people = [{name: "Jennie", role: "senior"},
                {name: "Ronald", role: "junior"},
                {name: "Martin", role: "senior"},
                {name: "Anneli", role: "junior"}]

let message = YOUR_CODE_HERE

console.log(message)
```
