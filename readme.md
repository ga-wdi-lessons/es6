# ES6

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the history of Javascript and ECMAScript
- Compare/contrast features of ES5 and ES6
- Explain when to use `var` vs. `let` vs. `const`
- Use template literals to interpolate variables and strings
- Use deconstruction to extract values from objects and arrays
- Use default parameters and arrow functions

## Framing (5 minutes / 0:05)

Today, we are going to be looking at a new way to write Javascript by playing with some of the new features released with ES6.

### Javascript vs. ECMAScript

The Javascript standard is officially referred to as [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript).

As Javascript is so widely used that any changes would affect the whole web, there is a body known as ECMA, which formally approves official versions for release. Each version contains features and changes to be added to the language.

In short, ECMAScript is the language, and JavaScript an implementation of that language.

#### Timeline

- **1999: ES3 released.** This was the first widespread use of the Javascript.
- **2009: ES5 released.** This is what we have been writing so far in class.
- **2015: ES6 published.** This brought about a wide set of new features and syntax.

#### Why now?

Many plugins, frameworks and modules still use ES5, as browser support for
the new version of the language is [still not universal](http://caniuse.com/#search=es6), but the new syntax and features of ES6 are increasingly becoming more and more popular in the developer world at large. You are very likely to see it pop up in the documentation of some of the technologies we will be using in this course.

Today is all about exploring some of the [new features](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) and getting comfortable with the new syntax.

> For more backstory, we recommend checking out [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlmsweSNhTw) from Brendan Eich on what he views as the future of Javascript.

## New Features

### Block Scope (10 minutes / 0:15)

<details>
  <summary><strong>What does the concept of scope refer to in Javascript?</strong></summary>

  > In short, the notion of which variables are available where.

</details>

<br>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What is the primary way to control scope in Javascript? Why do we want to control scope?</strong></summary>

  > Functions create new local scopes.
  >
  > Scope allows us to use generic variable names using `var` while considering them in an isolated space. This makes our code easier to reason about.

</details>

<br>

Let's revisit a code snippet from your "Scope & Context" lesson...

```js
teamName = "Giraffes" // What scope is this?
var teamCity = "Sioux Falls" // What scope is this?

function playBaseball() {
  console.log("From " + teamCity + "...") // Does this work?
  console.log("Welcome the " + teamName + "!") // Does this work?

  pitcherName    = "Jesse Shawl" // What scope is this?
  var batterName = "Breece Horper" // What scope is this?

  console.log(batterName)  // Does this work?
  console.log(pitcherName) // Does this work?
}
```

#### `let`

The fact that blocks of other special forms (`if`, `for`, `while`, etc) *do not* create scopes is one of the oddities for which Javascript sometimes gets knocked. Other languages -- like Python, C++ and Java -- have had this feature for a long time.

> [Here's a funny response](https://twitter.com/brendaneich/status/349768501583548416) from Javascript creator Brendan Eich on why the language did not come with block scope.

ES6 introduces the `let` keyword which works just like `var` but is scoped to its block (`{...}`) rather than its function.

Some examples of block scope are...
- `if` statements
- `while` and `for` loops
- functions
- singular `{ }` blocks

> Object literals **are not** code blocks. Object literals should always follow an assignment or be provided as an argument to a function but never stand on their own.

Prior to ES6, a popular technique for isolating a variable was to place it inside of an IIFE ("immediately invoked function expression"). This is because `var`s are ***function-scoped***. In contrast `let` statements are ***block scoped***, meaning they don't exist or are not accessible outside of curly braces `{}`.

```js
// ES5
var a = 1;
(function(){
  var a = 2
  console.log(a);
})();
console.log(a);
```


```js
// ES6
var a = 1;
{
  let a = 2;
  console.log(a);
}
console.log(a);
```

You're more likely to see `let` declarations inside an `if` or `for` block...

```js
// ES5
var age = 22
if(age >= 21){
  var canDrink = true
} else {
  var canDrink = false
}

console.log(canDrink)
// => true
```

```js
// ES6
var age = 22
if(age >= 21){
  let canDrink = true
} else {
  let canDrink = false
}

console.log(canDrink)
// => Uncaught ReferenceError: canDrink is not defined
```

<details>
  <summary><strong>After the block scope exercises, open this for notes on how <code>let</code> can be useful when writing <code>for</code> loops...</strong></summary>

  The function-scoped behavior of `var` and block-scoped behavior of `let` can have some puzzling but important differences in certain situations. We will delay the `console.log(i)` operation, or evaluating `i`, with `setTimeout` to highlight an important distinction in how **scope** with `let` and `var` operates differently.

  In the following scenario, since `var` is ***not block-scoped***, it "leaks" outside of the for-loop. This is not the case with `let`, which is **block-scoped**.

  ```js
  // ES5
  for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    setTimeout(function(){
      console.log(i)
    }, 200)
  }
  ```

  ```js
  // ES6
  for (let j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
    setTimeout(function(){
      console.log(j)
    }, 200)
  }
  ```

</details>

#### `const`

ES6 introduces another keyword for declaring variables: `const`. It declares a variable that won't be reassigned or redeclared.

```js
const a = 1;
a = 2;
// => Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

const a = 2;
// => Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared

var a = 2;
// => Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared
```

### Default Parameters (5 minutes / 0:35)

Here we've defined a function with three parameters. We then invoke the function with two arguments...

```js
function printAndSum(a, b, c){
  console.log(a)
  console.log(b)
  console.log(c)
  return a + b + c
}

printAndSum(1, 2)
// => 1
// => 2
// => undefined
// => NaN
```

<details>
  <summary><strong>Why does <code>printAndSum(1, 2)</code> return <code>NaN</code>?</strong></summary>

  > Because we are not passing in an argument for `c`, it is being automatically set to `undefined`. When you add `undefined` to two numbers, you get `NaN`. Hence, the return value in the above code snippet.

</details>

<br>

Let's imagine that we don't have a third argument `c` but we still want to add together the two numbers (`a` and `b`) that we do have. How could we make `printAndSum` return an actual number instead of `undefined`.

With ES6, we now have the option to set a default value for any of our functions' parameters...

```js
function printAndSum(a=0, b=0, c=0) {
  console.log(a)
  console.log(b)
  console.log(c)
  return a + b + c
}

printAndSum(1, 2)
// => 1
// => 2
// => 0
// => 3
```

### Destructuring (10 minutes / 0:55)

Destructuring makes it possible to extract data from collections (i.e., arrays and objects) into distinct variables.

#### Destructuring Arrays

Let's say we want to pull some values out of an array and save them in variables. With what we know so far, we would do something like this...

```js
// ES5

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]

const first = numbers[0]
const second = numbers[1]
const third = numbers[2]
const fourth = numbers[3]
```

With ES6, we can now destructure arrays and assign those variables like the below example. This can be very useful when you need to assign multiple variables at the same time.

```js
// ES6

const [first, second, third, fourth] = [1, 2, 3, 4]

console.log(first)
// => 1

console.log(second)
// => 2
```

We could also use this approach...

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
const [first, second, third] = numbers

console.log(first)
// => 1

console.log(second)
// => 2

console.log(third)
// => 3
```

> Array destructuring knows to begin assigning values from left to right. If we had also included a `fourth` variable inside of the array destructuring in the above example, it would have set it to 4.

#### Destructuring Objects

We can do something similar with objects. Let's say we have the following object, which represents a user...

```js
const bob = {
   id: 1,
   name: "Bob",
   age: 43 ,
   profileUrl: "http://api.co/users/1",
   location: "DC"
}
```

If we want to quickly extract some values from that object -- let's say `name` and `age` -- we can do the following...

```js
const {name: bobsName, age: bobsAge} = bob

console.log(bobsName)
// => "Bob"

console.log(bobsAge)
// => 43
```
> There is an even cleaner syntax we can use by integrating another ES6 feature discussed later in this lesson

We can do something similar with objects when passing them as arguments into a function...

```js
const bob = {
   id: 1,
   name: "Bob",
   age: 43 ,
   profileUrl: "http://api.co/users/1",
   location: "DC"
}

// ES5
function greetUser (user) {
  console.log("Hello " + user.name + ", how's the weather in " + user.location)
}

greetUser(bob)

// ES6
function greetUser ({ name, location })  {
  console.log("Hello " + name + ", how's the weather in " + location)
}

greetUser(bob)
```
> You can also do this with array destructuring

## Break (10 minutes / 1:15)

### Concise Object Literal Definitions (5 minutes / 1:20)

ES6 introduced more "concise" ways for us to define methods and attributes in our objects. The two techniques described below are small ways in which we can make objects just a little more clean!

#### Methods

ES6 allows us to eliminate the need to use the `function` keyword in object method definitions. So this...

```js
// ES5
var car = {
  make: "Volkswagen",
  model: "Tiguan",
  fuel: 0,
  drive: function(){
    console.log("vroom")
  },
  refuel: function(){
    this.fuel = 100
  }
}
```

...can be written using concise method definitions like this...

```js
// ES6
let car = {
  make: "Volkswagen",
  model: "Tiguan",
  fuel: 0,
  drive() {
    console.log("vroom")
  },
  refuel() {
    this.fuel = 100
  }
}
```

#### Properties

It is very common that we will set a property to the value of a variable by the same name.
ES6 lets us avoid this redundance.

```js
// ES5
var a = 1
var b = 2
let obj = {
  a: a,
  b: b
}

// ES6
let a = 1
let b = 2
let obj = { a, b }
```

> 5 minutes exercise. 5 minutes review.

### Template Literals (5 minutes / 1:35)

Oftentimes in Javascript we find ourselves building strings that incorporate dynamic values. For example, here's how we previously used variables to build custom strings...

```js
var name = "Inigo Montoya"
var killee = "father"
var prepareTo = "die"

console.log("Hello. My name is "+ name + ". You killed my " + killee + ". Prepare to " + prepareTo)
```

It can feel a little cumbersome to have to alternate between strings and variables. On top of that, we need to separate them using `+` signs.

ES6 introduces a template literal syntax for strings that makes the process a bit more seamless. The syntax is a little different than the way we traditionally write strings...
- Backticks surround the entire string template
- Line breaks are permitted
- `${...}` are placeholders for interpolating Javascript expressions

```js
let name = "Inigo Montoya"
let killee = "father"
let prepareTo = "die"

console.log(`Hello. My name is ${name}. You killed my ${killee}. Prepare to ${prepareTo}`)
```

> This does not mean that all strings need to be written this way! It only comes in handy when we need to reference dynamic values in a string.

> 5 minutes exercise. 5 minutes review.

### Arrow Functions (10 minutes / 1:55)

Arrow functions are a new shorthand syntax for defining anonymous functions. Let's revisit the way we currently write functions...

```js
function divide(dividend, divisor){
  const quotient = dividend / divisor
  return quotient
}
```

With arrow functions, we forgo the `function` keyword entirely. We would write the above example like so...

```js
const divide = (dividend, divisor) => {
  const quotient = dividend / divisor
  return quotient
}
```

> You might have noticed that the above example is written as a function expression -- not a declaration. We cannot define function declarations using arrow functions, which means that arrow functions cannot be hoisted.

If the function only has one argument, that argument does not need to be surrounded by parens...

```js
const square = num => {
  const product = num * num
  return product
}
```

But we do for functions that have no arguments...

```js
const doNothing = () => {
  console.log("I am doing nothing!")
}
```

#### Return Statements

Here is a standard multi-line arrow function written using no shorthands. With a multi-line function, you (usually) need to explicitly return (i.e., use the `return` keyword).

```js
const divide = (dividend, divisor) => {
  return dividend / divisor
}
```

If the function is single-line, however, you can omit both the return keyword and curly brackets...

```js
var divide = (dividend, divisor) => dividend / divisor
```

If the function is multi-line, you need to explicitly return. Otherwise, you get this...

```js
const divide = (dividend, divisor) => {
  dividend / divisor
}

divide(2,3)
// => undefined
```

Though the single line return can be faked by wrapping the expression in parentheses...

```js
const divide = (dividend, divisor) => (
  dividend / divisor
)
```

#### Context in Arrow Functions

Arrow functions also have the benefit of maintaining the context (`this`) of where the function is defined...

Context works differently in arrow functions than it does in ES5. Consider the below example.

<details>
  <summary><strong>What is the result of running <code>this.temperature++</code>? Why?</strong></summary>

  > `setInterval`'s callback is what we call an "unbound" function (i.e., it is stand-alone and not contained in an object). That means that it will default to a global context, which in the browser is the `window` object.
  >
  > When we call `this.temperature++`, Javascript looks for a `temperature` property on the `window` object. This does not occur naturally.
  >
  > If we `console.log(window.temperature)`, we see that it is `NaN`. This is the result of incrementing an `undefined` value by 1.

</details>

<br>

```js
var pizza = {
  temperature: 0,
  toppings: ["cheese", "ham", "pineapple"],
  bake() {
    setInterval(function() {
      this.temperature++
    }, 1000)
  }
}

pizza.bake()
console.log(pizza.temperature)
```

It would be nice, however, if we could use `this` in a similar way and have it work.

Let's try the same thing, except this time we will replace `setInterval`'s callback function with an arrow function.

<details>
  <summary><strong>What is the result of running <code>this.temperature++</code>? What might this tell us about context when using arrow functions?</strong></summary>

  > It incremented the `temperature` value stored in pizza!
  >
  > Perhaps unbound arrow functions do not default to the global scope...

</details>

<br>

```js
var pizza = {
  temperature: 0,
  toppings: ["cheese", "ham", "pineapple"],
  bake() {
    setInterval(() => {
      this.temperature++
    }, 1000)
  }
}

pizza.bake();
console.log(pizza.temperature)
```

An arrow function's context is defined by its enclosing context (i.e., where it is defined). In this case, that enclosing context is the `pizza` object. An arrow function does not create its own context, unlike an unbound `function` which would have created its own context -- `window`.

> Arrow functions will be very useful when working with higher-order functions, which you will learn about in your upcoming "[Functional Programming" lesson](https://github.com/ga-wdi-lessons/functional-programming).

## Bonus

### Spread Operator

The spread operator `...` allows an expression to be expanded into multiple elements.

This is useful for separating an array into individual elements...

```js
var dimensions = [10, 5, 2]
var volume = function(height, width, length){
  return height * width * length
}

// ES5
volume(dimensions[0], dimensions[1], dimensions[2])

// ES6
volume(...dimensions)
```

#### Avoiding Mutation

This also makes it very easy to create copies of an array in functions where
mutation occurs. Here is some code in which we generate a reversed array of days (`reversedDays`) from a sorted array of days (`days`). This approach ends up mutating the original `days` array.

```js
var days = ["monday","tuesday","wednesday","thursday","friday","saturday","sunday"]
function reversedDays(arr){
  return arr.reverse()
}
console.log(reversedDays(days))
// => Returns the reversed array of days.

console.log(days)
// => But now `days` is reversed as well.
```

We can use the spread operator to avoid this effect. Below you'll find two examples: one that does not use the spread operator and one that does.

```js
// ES5
function reversedDays(arr){
  var newArray = []
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    newArray.push(arr[i])
  }
  return newArray.reverse()
}
console.log(reversedDays(days))
console.log(days)

// ES6
function reversedDays(arr){
  return [...arr].reverse()
}
console.log(reversedDays(days))
console.log(days)
```
