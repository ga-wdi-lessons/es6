# Concise Object Methods & Properties Exercise

Each of the below code snippets will come with a prompt. It is your job to update the code snippet so that prompt is satisfied. Your answer must leverage what you just learned about concise object methods and properties.

The prompts will indicate which lines of code you cannot modify and/or touch. You are not restricted, however, from adding code to the existing code snippets.

#### 1

Complete the `car` function below so that it returns an object resembling the return values indicates in the snippet below.

> Hint: you'll need to use ES6 techniques learned earlier in this lesson to fully complete this exercise.

```js
function car(make, model, options){
  return // Your code goes here
}

const civic = car("Honda", "Civic")
// => { make: "Honda", model: "Civic", options: ["Power Steering"], drive: Function }
honda.drive()
// => "Vroom!"

const suburban = car("Chevrolet", "Suburban", ["4-Wheel Drive"])
// => { make: "Chevrolet", model: "Suburban", options: ["4-Wheel Drive"], drive: Function }
```
